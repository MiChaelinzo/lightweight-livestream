# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Hardware encoders are chosen only if a short test encode succeeds, else libx264 (`doctor` uses the same check).
- Stop retrying after 5 consecutive quick failures; report a missing ffmpeg at launch.
- Keep source aspect ratio (scale plus pad) instead of stretching.
- Validate fps, bitrate and config file shape; fix docs about the key prompt, emulator black capture and key visibility in process lists.
- Windows launcher no longer echoes the stream key.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: FFmpeg-driven CLI with presets, encoder auto-selection, low-priority runner with auto-reconnect, key redaction, launchers for Windows and Linux.
- Real streaming is UNVERIFIED (see README).
